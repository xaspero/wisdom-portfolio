            I am a full stack developer with one (1) year of experience in both application and presentation layers.
            I have built quite a few unique applications. I program in some of the major programming languages like
            Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. I combine versality with dedication to roll out cutting-edge programs 
            that make life meaningful and easy.

          Working with Wisdom has been an awesome experience.

          I had worked along with Wisdom during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          He is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain. 
          He will be an asset for any organisation!

            <span>&#8220;</span>
            As a Student of FUPRE, I had the honor of working with Wisdom. He is a unique fellow with a good sence 
            of humor. He dedicated most of his time towards coding solutions to the things we lack on campus, one of 
            which is the GPAcheckme Application. This has really helped the student community to be aware of their grades
            and concentrate more effort on the areas they need more efforts to top their grades.

            Working on projects with Wisdom is naturally cool. He takes you on a spin and finally land you in more work.
            At first this wasn't cool to me, but when I saw my skills developed ,I then new why I have to keep hanging out
            with Wisdom. He is a great guy.
